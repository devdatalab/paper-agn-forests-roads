\footnotesize{The figure displays a graphical form of the regression

  measured at baseline in bins defined by population relative to the
  rural road program treatment threshold. The linear fits and standard
  errors are estimated from Equation~\ref{eq:rd1}. The vertical line
  shows the treatment threshold; the jump in the fit at this line is
  the regression discontinuity treatment estimate. The dependent
  variable in each panel (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) is (A) log
  forest cover in 2000; (B) average forest cover in 2000; (C) change
  in log forest cover from 2000 to 2005; (D) the share of households
  whose primary cooking fuel is firewood; (E) the log of night light
  luminosity in 2000; and (F) average night light luminosity in
  2000. In Panel C, we omit villages with roads built before 2006, to
  ensure that balance estimates are not contaminated by the small
  number of treated villages before this date. All estimates include
  district-population threshold fixed effects.}

  Rural Roads on Forest Cover (Alternate Specifications)}
\newcommand{\tablenote}{ The table shows difference-in-differences
  estimates of the impact of new village roads on local forest cover,
  under alternate sample definitions. We define forest cover as log
  village forest cover; the data source is Vegetation Continuous
  Fields. Specifications are identical to those in
  Table~\ref{tab:panel} with the following changes. 
  Column 1 includes villages that did not receive PMGSY roads at any
  time as part of the control group. Column 2 adds village-specific time
  trends to show that the positive treatment estimate in Column 1 is
  driven by differential trends in never-treated villages. Columns 3
  and 4 repeat these two specifications with the standard set of
  villages to show that village-specific time trends do not affect our
  main estimates. Column 5 estimates the standard specification from
  Table~\ref{tab:panel} with treated villages only, but the dependent variable includes forest
  cover in a 5km radius from the village centroid. Column 6 uses a
  50km centroid. Award Period is an indicator
  variable that takes the value one for years after a road contract
  was awarded and before the road was completed. Completion period is
  an indicator variable that marks the years after a village's new
  road was built.  All regressions include village fixed effects,
  baseline population * year fixed effects, and baseline forest * year
  fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the village level to
  correct for serial correlation.}

    \cnewline Highways on Forest Cover: \cnewline Straight Line
    Instrumental Variables }
\newcommand{\tablenote}{
  The table shows reduced form estimates from regressions of distance
  band * time period interactions on forest cover. Distance bands are
  calculated to straight line approximations of the Golden
  Quadrilateral (Columns 1 and 2) and North-South/East-West (Columns 3
  and 4) highway corridors. The estimating equation is
  Equation~\ref{eq:gq}.  We define forest cover as log subdistrict forest
  cover (Columns 1 and 3) and average covered share of each subdistrict
  pixel (Columns 2 and 4); the data source is Vegetation Continuous
  Fields. The omitted distance category is the set of subdistricts at
  a distance of 200-300km from each set of straight line
  approximations. The construction period (rows 1 through
  4) is 2001 to 2004. The post period (rows 5 through 8) is 2005 to
  2008. Columns 3 and 4 estimate a placebo specification with
  distances to the NS-EW highway network, where construction had barely
  begun by 2008. The sample includes data from 2000 to 2008; 2000 is
  the omitted period. We omit years after 2008 as the placebo group is
  treated in those years. In Columns 3 and 4, we exclude places within
  150km of the GQ network to prevent sample contamination. All

    Highways on Forest Cover: Exploiting Construction Timing}
  \newcommand{\tablenote}{ The table shows alternate treatment estimates for the
    impact of the construction of the GQ highway network on forest
    cover in the proximity of the highway, which exploit the timing of construction of different
    segments. The estimating equation takes the form:
    $Forest_{ist} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 CLOSE_{is} + \beta_2 CONSTR_{t} +       \beta_3 POST_{t} + \beta_4 CLOSE_{is} * CONSTR_{t} + \beta_5 CLOSE_{is} * POST_{t} + \epsilon_{ist}\text{.}$
    $CLOSE_{is}$ takes the value one if a subdistrict is
    within 100 km of a segment of the GQ, and $POST_{t}$ refers to a
    time period after construction. The interaction between
    $CLOSE_{is}$ and $CONSTR_t$ describes the impact of GQ
    construction on a subdistrict's forests, and the interaction with
    $POST_t$ describes the impact after construction of the segment is
    complete.  In the table, Construction Year and Post-Construction
    Year refer to the construction and completion period for the
    nearest GQ segment to a subdistrict centroid. The Distance
    variables are indicators that take the value 1 if the nearest
    segment is within the given distance band. The sample is the set
    of subdistricts with centroids within 300km of the GQ. The omitted
    category is thus the band of places at a distance of 200-300km
    from the highway network.  We define forest cover as log
    subdistrict forest cover; the data source is Vegetation Continuous
    Fields.  All estimates include state-year fixed effects and
    baseline subdistrict population, forest cover and town distance
    interacted with forest observation year. Standard errors are
