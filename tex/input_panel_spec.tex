The sample consists strictly of villages that received new roads
between 2001 and 2013, and were not accessible by paved road in
2001. Award Period is an indicator variable that takes the value one
for years after a road contract was awarded and before the road was
completed. Completion period is an indicator variable that marks the
years after a village's new road was built. All regressions include
district*year fixed effects, village fixed effects, baseline
population * year fixed effects, and baseline forest * year fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered at the village level to correct
for serial correlation.
