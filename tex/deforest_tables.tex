\scriptsize{The figure shows regression discontinuity estimates of the impact of
new rural roads on local deforestation. Panel A shows the first stage
probability of a village receiving a new road before 2013 as a function of its
population relative to the population threshold. Each point shows the
mean of the Y variable in a given population bin. Panel B shows the
first stage RD estimate of a village receiving a new road by the year
indicated on the X axis. Each point is an estimate from an RD first
stage regression. Panel C is analogous to Panel B; the
dependent variable is the log of forest cover in 2013. The points show
the mean of this variable in each population bin; population is shown
relative to the population treatment threshold. Panel D shows reduced
form RD estimates of the impact of being above the population
threshold on forest cover in each year on the X axis. All estimates in
Panels B and D use the same specification as Table~\ref{tab:rd}, and
include district-population threshold fixed effects and a control for
baseline forest cover.}

\footnotesize{The figure shows year-by-year estimates of log forest
  cover in villages that received new roads between 2001 and
  2013. Villages are grouped on the X axis according to the year
  relative to road completion. Each point thus shows the average value
  of log forest cover in villages in a given year relative to the
  treatment year, controlling for village fixed effects, district*year
  fixed effects, baseline population * year and baseline log forest
  cover * year interactions. Standard errors are clustered at the
  village level. The year before road completion is omitted (t=-1);
  forest cover is thus shown relative to this period.}

  change in log subdistrict forest cover from 2000 to 2008 against
  distance to each highway network. By 2008, there was very little

\footnotesize{The figure shows point estimates from
  Equation~\ref{tab:gq}, with distances from the Golden Quadrilateral
  highway network specified in 100km bands. Each figure shows the
  point estimate on the 0-100km distance indicator, interacted with
  the year shown in the X axis. The omitted category is the set of
  places that are 200-300 kilometers from the Golden Quadrilateral
  network. The dependent variables in Panels A and B are log
  employment in respectively wood-consuming firms and in logging
  firms. Logging was not specified in the 2005 Economic Census so this
  point is omitted. In Panels C through E the dependent variable is
  the share of households' cooking fuel that takes the form of (C)
  firewood; (D) imported fuels, primarily propane; and (E) crop
  residue and animal waste. In Panel F, the dependent variable is the
  share of village land dedicated to agriculture.  All estimates are
  from regressions with state-year fixed effects and standard errors
  are clustered at the subdistrict level. Appendix
  Table~\ref{tab:app_gq_mech_land_fuel} shows the full set of
  estimates from the regressions that produced these graphs.}

      The table shows summary statistics for the samples used for

    only for villages that received new roads between 2001 and
    2011. The sample for the first four village-level variables
    consists of the set of villages that did not have a road at
    baseline. The sample for agricultural land and energy shares
    consists of all villages with non-zero forest cover at baseline.}

      treatment estimates of the effect of new village roads on local
      forest cover, estimated with Equation~\ref{eq:rd1}.  In Column
      1, the dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value
      one if a village received a new road in the sample period. Above
      Population Threshold is an indicator for a village population
      being above the treatment threshold. Columns 2 through 6 show
      reduced form estimates of the effect of being above the
      treatment population threshold. The dependent variables in
      Columns 2 and 3 respectively are log village forest cover and
      average covered share of each village pixel; the data source is
      Vegetation Continuous Fields. Columns 4 through 6 run the log
      forest cover specification on subgroups defined respectively by
      (i) above-median forest cover villages; (ii) above median share
      of Scheduled Tribes in a village; and (iii) below median
      baseline village assets. Columns 7 and 8 show IV estimates of
      the treatment effects of new roads, using respectively log and
      average forest cover as dependent variables.  The outcome
      variable in Columns 2 through 8 is measured in 2013. All
      estimates include district-population threshold fixed effects
      and a control for baseline forest cover.}

  \newcommand{\tablenote}{ The table shows treatment estimates for the
    impact of the construction of the GQ highway network on forest
    cover in the proximity of the highway, according to
    Equation~\ref{eq:gq}. We define forest cover as log subdistrict forest
    cover (Columns 1 and 3) and average covered share of each subdistrict
    pixel (Columns 2 and 4); the data source is Vegetation Continuous
    Fields. The distance variables are indicators that identify places
    within a given distance band from the GQ (Columns 1 and 2) or the
    NS-EW highway network (Columns 3 and 4). The omitted category is
    the band of places at a distance of 200-300km from the highway
    network.  These distance band indicators are then interacted with
    time period indicators. The construction period (rows 1 through 4)
    is 2001 to 2004. The post period (rows 5 through 8) is 2005 to
    2008. Columns 3 and 4 estimate a placebo specification
    with distances to the NS-EW highway network, where construction had
    barely begun by 2008. The sample includes data from 2000 to 2008; 2000 is the
    omitted period. We omit years after 2008 as the placebo group is
    treated in those years. In Columns 3 and 4, we exclude places within
    150km of the GQ network to prevent sample contamination. All
    estimates include state-year fixed effects and standard errors are
    clustered at the subdistrict level to account for 
    serial correlation.} \input{\filepath/table_gq}
